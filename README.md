# JavaScript, Babel, and Firebase

This project uses the [Babel CLI](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli) for compiling vanilla ES6 into browser-compatible JavaScript, and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting and deployment.

## Using the Project

1. Clone the repository.
1. Remove the .git folder: `rm -rf .git`
1. Initiate a repository locally: `git init`
1. On GitHub or similar, create a new repository. Copy its link.
1. Within the local repository, add the new repository as the remote url: `git remote add origin <new-repo-url>`
1. Setup the Node dependencies and setup hosting / deployment to Firebase.

## Node Prerequisite

It is assumed that you have Node installed either on your machine and can use Node commands from the terminal.

For example: I have a Windows 10 computer. I used [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) on my [Windows Linux Subsystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to install Node, and run all `npm` commands from an Ubuntu subsystem in the VSCode terminal.
